Is a more precautionary approach more resilient?\nPlease select the scenarios:\n\nRCP 8.5, lim. prod., FMSY * 50%\nRCP 8.5, lim. prod., FMSY * 75%\nRCP 8.5, lim. prod., FMSY * 100%\n\n The dynamic reference point for the spawning stock biomass (MSY Btrigger) is shown as a dashed line.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCompared to the previous exercise, where even the lowest fishing pressure failed to reach for longer time periods sustainable stock levels, the benchmarking system results in a higher spawning stock biomass reaching in the beginning of the assessed time period levels above the respective MSY Btrigger (except for the 100 % scenario). A more precautionary approach e.g. the 50 % scenario, does in fact lead to a higher SSB, thus it can be considered as more climate-resilient. But to the end of the century all scenarios show a decreasing trend.\nNote that in this model only a limited productivity is incorporated, since sustainable management is relatively easily achieved when assuming full productivity."

With the plots beneath you can find the answers to the first question on the poster:\n What implications do differing perceptions of stock productivity have on the future stock development?\nYou can see in the plot the observed time series, to answer the question please select in the legend (below the plot) the scenarios:\n\nRCP 8.5, full prod., FMSY\nRCP 8.5, lim prod., FMSY\n\n You can add / select the scenarios by simply clicking on the corresponding legend entry. If you want to isolate one scenario double-click on the legend entry.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Depending on the perceived productivity the spawning stock biomass develops differently. The full productivity is based on a stock-recruitment model fitted to the entire time series of data (1985 - 2020), whereas the limited scenario time series only takes into account the data from 2006 onward. According to recent studies the Western Baltic cod stock is locked in a low productivity regime (Möllmann et al. 2021), thus the limited productivity scenario assumes that the stock will be unable to switch back to the previous, higher productivity regime.\n To find out about the influence of fishing management scenarios please click on the arrow.\nMöllmann, C., Cormon, X., Funk, S., Otto, S.A., Schmidt, J.O., Schwermer, H., Sguotti, C., Voss, R. & Quaas, M.

The model is forced with data from temperature projections based on the RCP 4.5 and 8.5 emission scenarios. Two different productivity states, represented by different stock-recruitment functions, were tested. Model output was generated for fishing with constant FMSY, Fpa and Flim, as well as with dynamically-adapted FMSY (via simulated benchmark assessments).\nTo show you some highlights of our analysis and the usage of the interactive plots please go in the navigation bar at the top of this page to Static data.\nHave fun!"
