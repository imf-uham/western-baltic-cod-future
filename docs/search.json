Is a more precautionary approach more resilient?\nPlease select the scenarios:\n\nRCP 8.5, lim. prod., Fmsy * 50%\nRCP 8.5, lim. prod., Fmsy * 75%\nRCP 8.5, lim. prod., Fmsy * 100%\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCompared to the previous exercise, where even the lowest fishing pressure failed to reach for longer time periods sustainable stock levels, the benchmarking system results in a higher spawning stock biomass reaching in the beginning of the assessed time period levels above the respective MSY Btrigger (except for the 100 % scenario). A more precautionary approach e.g. the 50 % scenario, does in fact lead to a higher SSB, thus it can be considered as more climate-resilient. But to the end of the century all scenarios show a decreasing trend.\nNote that in this model only a limited productivity is incorporated, as we assume it better reflects the current situation."

    "text": "With this modelling exercise we evaluated the effects of a fixed fishing pressure on the Western Baltic cod population until the end of the century. With the plots beneath you can find the answers to the first to questions on the poster:\n What implications do differing perceptions of stock productivity have on the future stock development?\nYou can see in the plot the observed time series, to answer the question please select in the legend on the right the scenarios:\n\nRCP 8.5, full prod., Fmsy\nRCP 8.5, lim prod., Fmsy\n\nTip: You can add / select the scenarios by simply clicking on the corresponding legend entry. If you want to isolate one scenario double-click on the legend entry. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n Depending on the perceived productivity the spawning stock biomass develops differently. The full productivity scenario considers productivity values from the entire time series, whereas the limited scenario time series only takes into account the last XX years. According to recent studies the Western Baltic cod stock is locked in a low productivity regime, thus the limited productivity scenario will probably lead to more realistic results, reflecting the currently depressed stock status.\n To find out about the influence of fishing management scenarios please click on the arrow."
