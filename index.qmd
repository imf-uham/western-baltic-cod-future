title: "An interactive poster on the future of Western Baltic cod <i>(Gadus morhua)</i>"
---

On this website you can explore the results of an age-structured population model for Western Baltic cod. The model is forced with data from temperature projections based on the RCP 4.5 and 8.5 emission scenarios. Two different productivity states, represented by different stock-recruitment functions, were tested. Model output was generated for fishing with constant F~MSY~, F~pa~ and F~lim~, as well as with dynamically-adapted F~MSY~ (via simulated benchmark assessments).

To show you some highlights of our analysis and the usage of the interactive plots please go in the navigation bar at the top of this page to [Static data](prod-regime.qmd).

Have fun!
